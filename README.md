# High-throughput Calculation
1. doping.py, create.py, submit.py, and check.py are four main python files in High-throughput Calculation
2. All the generated POSCAR files are stongly recommanded to undergo MD-ML simulation to determine the most stable arrangement of atoms

# Decomposition Analysis
1. Ehull.py is a script to obtain the Ehull value for a material. 
2. DA.py can be applied to any pseudo structure, regardless of their existence or not. Hence, a new method named Decomposition Analysis is constructed to analyze the possible decomposition items with their fractions and formation energies.
