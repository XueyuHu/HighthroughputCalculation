# DecompositionAnalysis
1. Based on the pymatgen package, I wrote several scripts to generate four input files for DFT calculation using VASP.
2. Ehull.py is a script to obtain the Ehull value for a material. 
3. These scripts can be applied to any pseudo structure, regardless of their existence or not. Hence, a new method named Decomposition Analysis is constructed to analyze the possible decomposition items with their fractions and formation energies.
